Place your local media assets in this folder before running or deploying the app.

Required files (not committed):
- `dial-up.mp3` – the retro connection sound used during onboarding.
- `rick-roll.mp4` – the surprise video shown in the Rick Roll prank.

These files load at runtime via the `/assets/…` URLs referenced in `constants.ts`. Keep the filenames identical so the existing imports continue to work.
